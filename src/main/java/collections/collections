1- It is group of objects.
    -  its is single entity which is representing multiple objects.
    -  Collection framework: group of classes and interfaces by which we can represent group of objects into single entity.
    ==> array can hold only same type of data.
    if we create Object of Array we can store in array multiple data.
    ==> Array fixed in size. it is not growable in nature.
    ==> Arrays is not implemented any data structure.

    To overcome these limitations we use Collection framework

    Array                                       Collections
    == fix size                                 == growable in nature
    == Home-genius data                         == Homo and Hetro genius data
    == There is no underlying data structure    == Implemented by using underlying data structure

    MAIN INTERFACES
    1- Collection Interface == root interface

    Collections == it is a pre defined CLASS from java.utils package. It has to many methods that we use them for collection objects. Like sort method.

    2- List extends Collection
    Child of Collection.


    3- Set extends Collection

    4- Queue extends Collection
