both classes implement Map. Insertion order is not preserve.

Comparing HashMap and HashTable?


        HashMap                                                                 Hashtable
1- underlying data structure HashTable (HashCode)                       underlying data structure HashTable (HashCode)
2- key-value                                                            key-value
3- None-Synchronized(Multiple threads can access a methods at a time.   Synchronized (One thread can work on particular method, second thread have to wait)
4- Not Thread Safe                                                      Thread Safe
5- Performance is faster                                                Performance is low
6- One Null key and multiple Values are accepted                        No null key and null Value


both classes has same Map methods.
