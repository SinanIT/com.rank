map is independent interface. MAP is collection of entries.

when we use it?
if we have key and value pair object we use map. Every key and every value are object.

    -- No Duplicate Key allowed but value can be duplicate.
    -- Every Key value ste is Entry. Map is collection of entries.

HasMap and HashTable classes implement MAp interface.

HashMap: CLASS
        -- Underlying data structure is HashTable
        -- Insertion order is NOT preserve
        -- No duplicate key allowed but values can be stored in HashMap
        -- Null key is allowed only ones.

        whenever we have more number of search operations we use hashmap

Methods

put(Key, Value)  add an entry to hashmap
putAll(anotherMap) add map map to another map
get(Key); it returns the value of Key

remove(Key) it removes the entry
containsKey(key) it returns boolean value
containsValue(Value) it returns boolean
isEmpty() it returns boolean value
size() it returns size of map
clear() it removes all entries from Map

Methods related to Entries
keySet()  it retrieves all keys from Map. This method returns type is Set
values() it returns all the values from Map This method returns type is Collection

entrySet() it returns all the entry set as a SET

ENTRY interface which is inside the HashMap. It is sub interface

getKey()
getValue()
setValue()
