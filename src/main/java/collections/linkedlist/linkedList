LinkedList class additionally implements Dequeue interface also. Dequeue implements Queue.

when we choose array list when linked-list?

- retrieving operations good with arraylist. no good for other operations because of shifting need to much effort.

- ant insertions and deletions operations good with linked-list. there is no shifting on linked list.

        in linked list every element or object called node. Every node divided in three part. previous element address, element, next element address.

        ** if you have more number of retrieving operations we Should NOT use linked list

        -- allows duplication
        -- insertion order
        -- null values allowed
        -- no default size
        some methods implemented from stack and queue

        addFirst(obj); removeFirst(); getFirst(obj);
        addLast(obj);  removeLast();  getLast(onj);
